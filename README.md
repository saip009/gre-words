For those who don't know how to run a python script.
 - Installing Python
  - Download Python 2.7.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (NOTE: This will not work with Python 3.x)

  - To add python to path, follow [these steps](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7) or watch the previous video(skip to [1:55](https://youtu.be/gD4eulxGNok?t=1m55s))

 - Running a program
  - Open [command prompt](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8)
  - Navigate to program location using the [cd command](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands).
   Easiest way would be to create a folder called 'Python' in Desktop and store all programs in that folder and use
  ```sh
   $ cd Desktop/Python/ 
  ```
  - To run a program 'code.py', use
  ```sh
   $ python code.py
  ```
- That's it!
